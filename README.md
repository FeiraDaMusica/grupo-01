# Verbrar

Verbrar is a hybrid project; it's both a *mobile app and a tangible product* made with arduino. 

Its purpose is to make people with hearing loss or deaf people to feel music through other senses (vision and touch, through the app and the arduino respectively).

This open-source project was created in a hackathon whose theme was musical harmony. The teams were provoked to think on a solution that, besides its main function, could improve the musical market for both consumers and musicians.
